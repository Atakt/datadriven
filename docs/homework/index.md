# Optional homework

These exercises are **optional**. You can earn **extra points** that are added to your exam score. In the exercises and the evaluation results, you will see a text “iMsc”; please ignore that (it is for the Hungarian students). All exercises are available for extra points on this course. Here you find the exercise descriptions; the submission of the solutions is expected via GitHub Classroom.

!!! important "Working code"
    You are expected to write code that actually works! Your code will be executed, and it is required to fulfill the specified task.

## The exercises

1. [MSSQL server-side programming](mssql/index.md)
1. [ADO.NET data access](adonet/index.md)
1. [Entity Framework](ef/index.md)
1. [MongoDB](mongodb/index.md)
1. [REST API and Web API](rest/index.md)

## Submission

Each homework must be submitted in a personal git repository. Please refer to the detailed [guideline here](GitHub.md). You must carefully study these guidelines!

!!! danger "IMPORTANT"
    The submissions of the homework **must** follow these guidelines. Submissions not adhering to the expected format are not considered.

    Workflow errors, i.e., not following the guidelines (e.g., not assigning the right person, or not assigning at all) are penalized.

## Screenshots

Some of the exercises require you to create a screenshot. This screenshot is proof of the completion of the exercise. **The expected content of these screenshots is detailed in the exercise description.** The screenshot may include the entire desktop or just the required portion of the screen.

!!! info ""
    The screenshots must be submitted as part of the solution code, uploaded to the git repository. The repositories are private; only you and the instructions can access them. If there is any content on the screenshot that is not relevant to the exercise and you would like to remove, you can obscure these parts.

## Submission evaluation

The evaluation of the exercises is **semi-automatic**. Your code will be executed; therefore, it is vital to follow the exercise descriptions precisely (e.g., use the provided code skeleton, change only the allowed parts of the code, etc.).

You will receive a preliminary result about your submission in GitHub; see in the guideline [here](GitHub.md)). If there are some issues you need to diagnose, the entire log of the execution is available for you on the _GitHub Actions_ web page. A short introduction is provided [here](GitHub-Actions.md).

!!! danger "Verification"
    In some of the exercises, where the technology permits, you will find unit tests. These tests **help** you verify your work, but these are **no substitution for your validation**. When you upload your work, more exhaustive testing will evaluate your submission.
